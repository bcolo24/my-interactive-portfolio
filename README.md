# my-interactive-portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was created to display all of the websites I have created as a student web developer. I wanted to create this webpage to store all of my websites in one place. Futhermore, I will apply to jobs in the future and give my employer a portfolio so they can see the skills I have. This is very important to do as a web developer because it shows professionalism. If I did not have this portfolio, I may have a harder time getting a job. I would also be disorganized and have to go through Github or VS code to access my work. Now, it will be on display for others to easily access. While making this page, I learned how to appropriately apply html and css- specifically, flexbox and media queries to successfully make a website responsive to different screen sizes.
